### MVP Architecture:
Strictly followed MVP architecture. This helps in proper deep Unit testing and code modularity.

---
### MOCKITO (Unit testing):
Please refer to the following two files to get the pattern on Unit testing we can add with the MVP architecture.
- [DashBoardFragmentTest](https://github.com/AabidMulani/android-redmart-assignment/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/redmartassignment/android/app/fragment/DashBoardFragmentTest.java)
- [RedMartProductDetailsActivityTest](https://github.com/AabidMulani/android-redmart-assignment/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/redmartassignment/android/app/activities/RedMartProductDetailsActivityTest.java)

##### Please Note:
1) The above two classes are just to give a pattern of test cases. These files have not covered all the use cases.
2) We could have easily extended this project with Espresso for UI testing with Mock API response

---
### Animations & Custom View:

- Implemented [Shared View Transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA2Axt5LjKQ) while showing details view of the product. That was very easy to add :)
- Please refer the the [WIDGETS](https://github.com/AabidMulani/android-redmart-assignment/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/redmartassignment/android/widgets) package for all the relevant custom view used in the project.
